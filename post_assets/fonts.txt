usual:

noto sans / noto serif

more uptight (closer to helvetica / computer modern):

PT sans / cormorant garamond

titles:

sans: Montserrat (light/black)
loud sans: alfa slab one
serif: DM Serif Text
loud serif: Playfair Display (black)

all the above are google fonts and thus should work anywhere, but just in case - 
web-safe fallbacks, in the same order:

verdana, georgia
arial, times new roman

there are no great options for titles, so let's just
arial
arial (black) or arial
georgia
georgia (bold) or georgia
