A few tools and projects I've put together. Most everything here is 2-10K LOC, fairly polished, explained more in depth in their readmes - only blurbs here.

### Tansō

> **Tansō** is an anki addon for sentence mining and flashcard generation, designed to make japanese learning more natural, more contextual, and less of a chore. It integrates with Anki to automatically enrich your flashcards with example sentences, clean audio, and dictionary definitions, all drawn from a carefully curated and properly licensed database of over 20 million multilingual sentence pairs.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/tanso). Feature-complete, development on hold.

### planets

> **Planets** is an astrology website. Its main selling points are that it looks neat and has more configuration options than anyone could possibly need.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/planets/event), also deployed [on this website](https://xaviaclm.github.io/planets/). Usable, but there's a lot more I want to add.

### resonant

> **Planets** is an astrology website. Its main selling points are that it looks neat and has more configuration options than anyone could possibly need.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/resonant). Complete, open to expansion.

### AspireAPI

> **AspireAPI** is a lightweight Python wrapper around [Aspire Budgeting](https://aspirebudget.com/), offering a structured interface to its Google Sheets-based system. It exposes Aspire’s envelopes, transactions, and dashboard data as Python objects, making scripting against the spreadsheet more low-fricton and less error-prone. All operations are live, so you're always working directly with the current state.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/aspire-api). Complete.

### cps-sat

> **cps-sat** is a small constraint modeling library built around Boolean formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF), designed for use with external SAT solvers such as Kissat. It provides a Python interface for constructing problems compositionally - from basic propositional atoms to reification, cardinality, and others.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/cps_sat). Complete.
