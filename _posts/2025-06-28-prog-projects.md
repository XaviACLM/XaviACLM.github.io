A few tools and projects I've put together. Most everything here is 2-10K LOC, fairly polished, explained more in depth in their readmes - only blurbs here.

### Tatoebator

> **Tatoebator** is an anki addon for sentence mining and flashcard generation, designed to make japanese learning more natural, more contextual, and less of a chore. It integrates with Anki to automatically enrich your flashcards with example sentences, clean audio, and dictionary definitions, all drawn from a carefully curated and properly licensed database of over 20 million multilingual sentence pairs.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/tatoebator). Feature-complete, but development on hold.

### resonant

> **resonant** is a tool for generating emotionally coherent playlists (/trees) by analyzing the affective properties of your music. It ingests songs (automatically pulled from your YouTube likes/history), tags and downloads them with metadata and cover art, and computes vector embeddings representing their affective feel. A webui uses this data to build playlists that help you explore your library and surface forgotten favorites.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/resonant). Complete, open to expansion.

### AspireAPI

> **AspireAPI** is a lightweight Python wrapper around [Aspire Budgeting](https://aspirebudget.com/), offering a structured interface to its Google Sheets-based system. It exposes Aspireâ€™s envelopes, transactions, and dashboard data as Python objects, making scripting against the spreadsheet more low-fricton and less error-prone. All operations are live, so you're always working directly with the current state.

On [Github](https://github.com/XaviACLM/aspire-api). Complete.

### cps-sat

> **cps-sat** is a small constraint modeling library built around Boolean formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF), designed for use with external SAT solvers such as Kissat. It provides a Python interface for constructing problems compositionally - from basic propositional atoms to reification, cardinality, and others.
