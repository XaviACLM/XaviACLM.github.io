This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website, specifically a graftjob of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and [Compass](https://github.com/excentris/compass). All three of these are distributed under the MIT License, as is every modification I've made to the latter two in this website, so you can fork [this website's repository](https://github.com/XaviACLM/XaviACLM.github.io) under that license. Of course this doesn't cover any of the actual material on the site, but you're welcome to make a copy of the whole thing and fill it with your own content.
