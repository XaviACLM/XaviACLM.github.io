Some of the things I've made over the years to help me (and others) learn languages.

### Chinese grammar Anki deck

A deck containing almost every example sentence from the AllSetLearning Chinese Grammar Wiki, all complete with pinyin, translation, usage guides and high-quality AzureTTS readings. On [AnkiWeb](https://Ankiweb.net/shared/info/995388817).

### Japanese grammar Anki deck

A deck containing every entry from (all books of) the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar, including example sentences, with audio and furigana. On [AnkiWeb](https://Ankiweb.net/shared/info/694862490) and [GitHub](https://github.com/XaviACLM/dojg-furigana).

### furigana

A minimal-dependencies python module to add furigana to japanese text. On [GitHub](https://github.com/XaviACLM/furigana/tree/master/furigana).

### new_card_highlighter

An Anki addon to highlight cards upon first contact. On [AnkiWeb](https://Ankiweb.net/shared/info/1092159027) and [GitHub](https://github.com/XaviACLM/Anki_new_card_highlighter).

### card transfer

A script to transfer scheduling data between different Anki decks. Not really user-friendly at all but extremely useful about once a year or so. On [GitHub](https://github.com/XaviACLM/Anki-sched-transfer).

### Tans≈ç

In-development but already usable Anki addon. Maintains a database of 20M+ Japanese example sentences, is capable of automatically finding the relevant examples to add to your flashcards. On [GitHub](https://github.com/XaviACLM/tanso).
