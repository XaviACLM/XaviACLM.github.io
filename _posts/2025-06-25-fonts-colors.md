I keep here a list of my frequently used colors and fonts for reference &mdash; largely for myself, but feel free to take anything. This website uses #934, #eed, Noto Sans, Noto Serif, and Playfair Display Extrabold.

### Colors

Text version [here]({{ '/' | relative_url }}files/palette.txt).

### Fonts

**Usual**

Noto Sans / Noto Serif

More uptight (closer to Helvetica, Computer Modern): PT Sans / Cormorant Garamond

**Titles**

- Sans serif: Montserrat (Light-er)
- Loud sans serif: Montserrat (Black), maybe Alfa Slab One
- Serif: DM Serif Text
- Loud Serif: Playfair Display (Black)

**Fallbacks**

I don't know that having web-safe fallback really matters since google fonts, but in the same order as before: Verdana / Georgia / Arial / Times New Roman. There aren't great options for titles - probably just Arial / Arial / Georgia / Georgia, attempting to make the loud ones black or bold.
