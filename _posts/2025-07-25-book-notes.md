## Spare bits

- Other people are smarter than you think. Many things can be left unsaid.
- Larger strides. Eye contact. Smile. All more than feels natural.
- Verbalize good thoughts about others. People can't read your mind.
- Polarize people. The last thing you want is for people to have a low-intensity opinion of you. Dislike is better than indifference (...is better than revulsion).
- Talk as if though you're talking to the most important person in the room + they already like you.
- Becoming interested in other people also means not vying to make them become interested in you.
- Give people what they want. Often this is to be heard (repeated) or to receive assurance.

About the following. I feel HtWFaIP is not all that applicable - mostly that which is already internalized, beyond reach, or already in the list above. Charisma Myth is very long - here are some favorite takeaways:

- Be present.
- Rewrite reality: reckless driver -> wife in labor, etc.
- Expand your comfort zone in low-stakes situations.
- Appreciate others. Focus on the things you like about them.
- Compassion and gratitute, towards yourself (internal, external), everyone else, everything else.
- Posture dictates your own emotion more than you think, even in private.
- Imagine yourself as an incognito movie star.
- Be less eager, be more warm.
- Pause before speaking. Speak slower. Change intonation. Aim words at people. Smile on specific sentences.
- Focus on people's eye color.
- Maybe: stop communicating uncertainty. Lying is fine.
- Copy people's manner of speech. Metaphors, particularly.
- Everyone understands the purpose of getting-to-know-you questions.
- Use "you" instead of "I": "I read this article on NYT recently" -> "You might like this article in the NYT..."
- Very loosely, mirror position when listening, take up space the rest of the time.
- Find stubbornness within, in the positive and in the negative.

## Material I might get to in the future

- The Scout Mindset: I think we're already pretty ok at this + unclear that a related behavioural change would make me any happier, but it's probably better that the alternative.
- Atomic Habits: people I respect say this is a good book.
- The Manson book: I think Marri liked this? From the first couple chapters it seemed like a nice distilling of early post-pua trp minus all the misogyny. "How to be cool" book disguised as a "how to get women" book by way of "get women by being cool".
- Actual PUA texts: The Game(s), extremely old pua material (stylemogging, durden, nlp, etc), mystery method, etc, as well as the 2010s stuff like (pre-godpill) rooshv and the like. This is (a) out of date (b) not that relevant to our use case (c) overhyped, but there might be something worthwhile to extract (e.g. triangle method).
- 4-hour workweek: Likely out of date by now, but might be an interesting reread a la the game as an insight into the genealogy of hustle culture. Very possibly some stuff of interest to distill re: how Ferris' approach to business translates to everything else.
- Never Split the Difference: This book had some interesting ideas but is worse than Carnegie for turning two-sentence concepts into 20 pages of anecdotes about how cool the author is. Also was sincerely about negotiation, which needen't directly translate to anything relevant. Might be useful a la techniques for handling (not-necessarily-serious) disagreement -> staying in the correct mindspace.

## How to win friends and influence people

###Techniques in handling people

- Don't criticize, condemn or complain
- Give honest and sincere appreciation
- Arouse in the other person an eager want

### Six ways to make people like you

- Become genuinely interested in other people
- Smile
- Use the other person's name
- Be a good listener - encourage others to talk about themselves
- Talk in terms of the other person's nterests
- Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely

### Win people to your way of thinking

- The only way to get the best out of an argument is to avoid it
- Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "you're wrong"
- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically
- There's a few more here but I don't think they're relevant.

### Be a leader: Change people without arousing resentment

- Begin with praise and honest appreciation
- Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
- Let the other person save face.
- "Hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise"
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to
- Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.

## The Charisma Myth

chapter 1 is just introduction.

### Chapter 2

- Charisma has three essential components: presence, power, and warmth.
- Being present, paying attention to what's going on rather than your own thoughts, can yield immense rewards. Those around you feel listened to, respected, valued.
- Much of this is telegraphed through body language.
- Internal state is critical. Mind cannot distinguish imitation from reality - create an internal farce of charisma and it will pour out.

### Chapter 3

- Any internal discomfort (physical or mental) has an effect. Eliminate them. Preferably plan ahead.
- Mental may be more complicated. Substance abuse works, but there's ideas such as responsibility transfer, or imagining something as a monolithic burden shared by many.
- Self-criticism, dissatisfaction, self-doubt, etc, is normal. Do not push them away, but do not heed them - let them pass.

### Chapter 4

- Mind generates thoughts - these are flickers, not reflections of anything deep. They can be dropped.
- Rewrite reality - reckless driver was probably rushing to the hospital b/c wife was in labor.
- Imagine things going really well, imagine things going really badly.

### Chapter 4 bonus track: expanding one's comfort zone

- Some exercises for the above.
- Hold eye contact longer than is comfortable. Stand deeper into someone's personal space than is comfortable. Face away from the door on an elevator.
- Some others - stuff that is right out of the Ferris book or old school PUA shit, e.g. hi exercise and such. Good? Maybe? If we get desperate?
- Com el Sistach.

### Chapter 5

- On the subject of manifesting charismatic states of mind.
- Visualization.
- Being thankful: for the world around you, for attributes of oneself (public and private).
- Projecting goodwill is important. The base for this is feeling it: focus on the things you like about the other person. Empathy -> sympathy -> compassion.
- Self-confidence vs self-esteem vs self-compassion.
- Compassion towards all beings, and viewing oneself as one who practices it.
- Body changes mind: Try to feel happy in a depressed posture, try to feel sad while jumping around. Similar cues for confidence and the like.
- Imagine oneself as an incognito movie star.

### Chapter 6: Charisma styles.

- "Styles" is pretty not a good name here. Charisma modes? Regimes?
- Focus charisma: The kind a CEO exudes when paying full attention to someone at that person's desk. More natural to me. Depends fundamentally on the ability to communicate respect - indeed, the ability to have respect. Risks: Avoid coming off as too eager (-> low-status, subservient) or cold (-> interrogation).
- Visionary charisma: Banish uncertainty - appear as if though you are fully confident in everything you believe.
- Kindness charisma: Abscence of judgement. Mostly warmth + a bit of power. 
- Authority charisma: this is what most people mean when they say charisma. Not really in our reach. Perceived power to affect the world. Body language, appearance, title, reactions of others. 
- Bonus track: Dramatic increases when wearing designer clothes vs identical clothes but no label. 13% -> 52% survey takers, double the amount of donations (in a mall).

### Chapter 7: Charismatic first impressions.

- We've known this. Thought experiments reveal these are dramatically important.
- Clothing is important. Dress (1) in the same style as the people you're meeting, (2) respectable.
- Handshakes: that's fine, we're already good at those.
- On breaking the ice: That's a nice necklace, what's the history behind it? Where are you from? What was it like growing up there? What brings you here tonight? These are all obvious getting-to-know-you questions - this is fine, everyone knows that's why you're there. Keep on positive subjects. Fact -> personal note -> redirect, to respond to questions when you want to punt it the other way.
- Use "you" instead of "I": "I read this article on NYT recently" -> "You might like this article in the NYT..."
- Use people's vocabulary. Steal their metaphors. Tailor yours to their domains.
- Book offers some techniques on leaving conversations but they all sound shit, which suggests I have a warped perception of the subject. Nice meeting/talking -> recommend book/w/e -> peace out.

### Chapter 8: Speaking and listening.

- Several of these need several grains of salt.
- Let other people talk.
- Pause before speaking. Thinking face is good, but clear pause is good also.
- Take compliments. Be thankful. 
- Metaphors, graphical comparisons, etc.
- Be careful with "pink elephant" phrases. "It won't kill you" makes people think of death.
- Maximize value per time: Maximize value (entertainment, information, nice feelings), minimize time.
- Voice is (very) important. Don't be monotone!!
- Imagine your words as arrows. Aim them at people.
- Smiling infuses warmth into your voice. Even just imagining it works.

### Chapter 9: Charismatic body language.

- Mirroring. This also works with voice/intonation. Mirror esp. at the start and when you listen, gradually go into normal posture when speaking.
- Relative position. Best is side-to-side, then 90 deg, then face-to-face. People sitting with their back to the wall will be more at ease - consider if this is best for you or for another.
- Eye contact. Search for colors. Soft focus mostly, related to presence.
- That BJJ exercise.
- Take up space. This doesn't look as corny as you imagine. Once you're comfortable, be still.

### Chapter 10: Difficult situations

- Give people what they want, specifically: To be acknowledged? Respected? Comforted? Appreciated?
- The Ben Franklin effect.
- The same way you would channel stubborn self-rightenousness, channel stubborn empathy.
- On delivering criticism: Timing, location. Empathy. Be specific: talk about the behaviour, not the person.
- Not all that relevant... skipping.
- Skipping the rest of the book for now, actually, not that relevant for now (On Presentations, Charisma in a Crisis, "The Charismatic Life")
